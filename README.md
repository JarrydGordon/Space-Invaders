# Space Invaders Game

    A modern implementation of the classic Space Invaders game with enhanced features, built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

    ## Features

    - üöÄ Classic Space Invaders gameplay
    - üéØ Dynamic death probability calculation
    - üî¢ Limited bullets (3x number of invaders)
    - ‚ö° Fast-paced invader movement, with some randomized individual variations for a more dynamic swarm.
    - üìä Real-time statistics display
    - üö® Bullet depletion warning system
    - üèÜ Win/Lose conditions with messages
    - üéÆ Keyboard controls for movement and shooting
    - üß± **Object-Oriented Design:** Core game logic has been refactored into JavaScript classes (`Game`, `Player`, `Invader`, `Bullet`) for improved structure, maintainability, and scalability.
    - üîä **Sound System Framework:** Integrated with the Web Audio API, preparing the game for sound effects and music (actual audio assets and full playback are implemented via simulation, ready for real assets).

    ## How to Play

    1. **Movement**:
       - Use ‚Üê (Left Arrow) or 'A' key to move left
       - Use ‚Üí (Right Arrow) or 'D' key to move right

    2. **Shooting**:
       - Press Spacebar to shoot bullets
       - You have limited bullets (currently 250, can be adjusted)

    3. **Gameplay**:
       - Destroy all invaders to win
       - Prevent invaders from reaching the bottom of the screen
       - Avoid collision with invaders
       - Watch the death probability increase as invaders get closer
       - Manage your bullets carefully

    4. **Game End**:
       - Win: Destroy all invaders
       - Lose: Invaders reach the bottom, player collides with an invader, or you run out of bullets with invaders remaining.

    ## Installation

    ### Prerequisites
    - Node.js (v14 or higher)
    - npm (v6 or higher)

    ### Setup
    1. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/JarrydGordon/Space-Invaders.git
       cd space-invaders
       ```
       (Note: The actual repo URL might differ for this exercise)

    2. Install dependencies (if any, for this project, it's vanilla JS but Vite was mentioned previously):
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
       (If not using Vite or similar, this step might not be needed for vanilla JS)

    3. Start the development server (if using Vite):
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```
       If not using a dev server, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

    4. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for Vite) or the `index.html` file.

    ## Game Mechanics

    ### Death Probability Calculation
    The game calculates death probability based on:
    - Number of remaining invaders
    - Remaining bullets
    (The original README mentioned proximity, which is not explicitly in the current simplified `calculateDeathProbability` function in `game.js`.)

    ### Bullet System
    - Total bullets are initialized (e.g., 250).
    - When bullets run out, a warning appears and a sound is triggered.

    ### Invader Movement
    - Horizontal speed increases as invaders are destroyed.
    - Some invaders have slight variations in their horizontal and vertical movement speeds.
    - Movement pattern: Side-to-side with downward steps when an edge is hit.

    ## Project Structure

    The project primarily consists of:
    ```
    space-invaders/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html            # Main HTML file, sets up the canvas and loads scripts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.js               # Core game logic, including all class definitions (Game, Player, Invader, Bullet)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js               # Initializes and starts the Game object from game.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
    ```
    (Assuming no `public/` or `src/` subdirectories for this vanilla JS version unless Vite is actively used).
