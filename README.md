    ## Game Mechanics

    ### Death Probability Calculation
    The game calculates death probability based on:
    - Number of remaining invaders (40%)
    - Proximity of invaders to the ship (40%)
    - Remaining bullets (20%)
    - Immediate 100% if invaders reach the ship

    ### Bullet System
    - Total bullets = 3 √ó number of invaders
    - When bullets run out, a warning appears
    - Warning message: "OhNOO! Chance of Death 100%"

    ### Invader Movement
    - Horizontal speed: 3x faster than classic
    - Vertical movement: Smaller increments (10px)
    - Movement pattern: Side-to-side with downward steps
